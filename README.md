COMP 20 Fall 2015 Private Repo for Daniel Baigel

1. The purpose of this README is to assess 
   myself on what I have accomplished and how much I have 
   grown in this class. The purpose of the git repository
   is to demonstrate all the projects and labs that I have
   done throughout the semester to show what I have learned.

2. My favorite lab or assignment was the MapChat assignment.
   It was my favorite because it was a visual project where
   I was able to see my results after writing code in a cool
   map UI. I was also able to see my classmates whereabouts.

3. I have definitely grown from day 1 of the course. I came into
   the course with html and css experience, but no javascript
   mongo, node.js, heroku, or security experience. Since day 1
   I have learned about all those aspects of web programming.

4. The most important thing that I learned in this course was
   how each piece of web development fits together. We learned about
   the static web page (html, css), and then we learned about how
   to make it more dynamic (javascript). Once we had a front end,
   we then implemented a back end with node.js and mongo applications,
   and served it on heroku. Examples of where these ideas came together
   were in the server project (assignment 3) and the security assignment
   (assignment 4). 

5. After finishing the course, I would like to delve deeper into the 
   topic of web security!
