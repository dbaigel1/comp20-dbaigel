<h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> The product that I've been hired to analyze is called MapChat.
        It allows users to send a message to their classmates, sharing their 
        location in the process. All users can see their classmates locations.
        I have been hired to penetration test and analyze the source code
        in order to report 3 web security issues that I have found.
    </p>

<h1> Methodology </h1>
    <p> I used a chrome extension called Postman to send test queries to the
        server.

    </p>

<h1> Abstract of Findings </h1>

<h1> Issues Found </h1>
    
    <h3> Issue 1: Cross Site Scripting during user input</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The issue here is one called Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
            
            <li>The issue was found when sending the server a user's location :
            URL/sendLocation</li>
            
            <li>The severity of this issue is medium. The only reason that it is not
            high severity is because the attacker needs to know the format of
            the data that the database requires. If an attacker can get this
            information, then the severity would be higher because XSS allows
            the attacker to completely deface the site.</li>
            
            <li>He/She can inject code
            to forward the site to a new site, or change content of the site. As seen in the 'message' section of 
            the postman screenshot below <img src="xss_postman.png"> </li>
            
            <li>After the postman query has been sent to the database, this is what happens when someone
                tries to access the original webpage mysterious-hamlet-3112.herokuapp.com <img src="xss_result.png"></li>
            
            <li> This issue could be resolved by sanitizing user input in the app.post /sendLocation
            method : app.post('/sendLocation', function(request, response), seen on line 55 of the index.js file.
            Sanitizing user input means clearing out all input with html code and/or script tags before entering it into the database. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        
            
             
            
          
        

    <h3> Issue 2: Inherent privacy issues with displaying user's locations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The issue here is one called Sensitive Data Exposure</li>
            
            <li>The issue was found when visiting the home page of the site, and seeing every other
                user's specific geolocation, the time that they checked into the location,
                their names, and their messages</li>
            
            <li>The severity of this issue is high. The issue lies within the entire idea of the application
                This app allows you to see sensitive information about other people without having to do any sort
                of security attacking! I rate this as high severity because it requires no skills to gain valuable
                information about other people.
            </li>
            
            <li>Anyone with internet access can visit the webpage : 'http://mysterious-hamlet-3112.herokuapp.com/' and gain valuable information.
                Here is a screenshot, proving the vulnerability.
                <img src="privacy.png"> </li>
            
            
            <li> This issue is inherent within the entire idea of the purpose of the application. In order to resolve the issue,
                 the app should not display any sensitive user information to the entire public, including geolocation, and timestamps. 
            </li>
        </ul>
